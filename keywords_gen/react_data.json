    "question": " What is React JS?",
    "answer": "React JS is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components in web applications. React JS is developed and maintained by Facebook (Meta) and a community of individual developers and companies. React JS enables developers to create reusable UI components. React JS makes it simpler to manage the state and data flow in large applications. React is used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next JS. React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. Understanding its core concepts such as components, JSX, and the virtual DOM is crucial if you're diving into React JS technical interviews.",

    "question": " What are the components in React?",
    "answer": "Components in React are reusable, self-contained building blocks that dictate how UI should appear and behave. Components in React enable developers to split the user interface into independent, manageable sections. Each component has its own state and props, allowing it to render dynamically based on data. React applications are typically composed of multiple components, nested and interacting with each other. Use components to create and maintain scalable, efficient, and readable React applications.",

    "answer": "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM elements. Virtual DOM\u2019s primary purpose is to boost the efficiency and performance of updating the UI in web applications. React creates a Virtual DOM to track changes instead of making direct changes to the real DOM. React then compares the current Virtual DOM with the previous one and calculates the best way to make these changes. This process is known as \"reconciliation\". Updates to the real DOM are batched and executed in the most efficient manner, leading to optimized performance and a smoother user experience.",

    "answer": "React handles events using a synthetic event system. React\u2019s synthetic event system is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event system. This system provides a consistent API across different browsers.\n\n\nEvent handlers in React are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase. For example, `onClick` instead of `onclick`. Event handlers in JSX are passed as functions, not strings. Event handlers in React must call `preventDefault` explicitly to prevent default behavior, unlike traditional DOM event handlers.\n\n\nEvents in React are pooled, meaning that for performance reasons, the event object's properties are nullified after the event callback has been invoked. So accessing event properties in an asynchronous way is null. Retain the event values by calling `event.persist()`.\n\n\nReact handles events using its own synthetic event system.",

    "answer": "React components have a lifecycle that consists of 3 phases. Each phase has a set of lifecycle methods that are called at specific points in the component\u2019s lifecycle. These methods allow you to control the component\u2019s behavior and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle. A component\u2019s lifecycle has three main phases, the Mounting Phase, Updating Phase, and the Unmounting Phase.\n\nMounting Phase: \n\n\nThe mounting phase is triggered when a component is initiated and added to the DOM. The methods involved in the Mounting phase are listed below.\n\n\n`constructor()`: Sets up the state and binds the methods.\n\n`render()`: Produces the virtual DOM from current props and state.\n\n`componentDidMount()`: Handles tasks after mounting, like fetching data.\n\n\nUpdating Phase: \n\n\nThe updating phase is triggered by changes in props or state. The methods involved in the updating phase are listed below.\n\n\n`getDerivedStateFromProps()`: Updates state based on props before render.\n\n`shouldComponentUpdate()`: Determines if re-rendering is needed.\n\n`render()`: Regenerates the virtual DOM with updated data.\n\n`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`: Captures info before the DOM update.\n\n`componentDidUpdate()`: Handles tasks post-update.\n\n\nUnmounting Phase: \n\n\nThe unmounting phase is triggered when a component is about to be removed from the DOM.

Also, use lifecycle methods available to prevent a component from rendering. Use the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method in class components or the `React.memo` function for functional components to prevent a component from rendering. The `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method returns a boolean value in class components. Instruct React not to re-render the component by returning `false` as a boolean value.

This approach is valuable for isolating and testing individual components in isolation, making it particularly suitable for unit testing. Shallow rendering provides a quick way to verify a component's behavior without delving into its underlying structure.\n\n\nFull rendering involves rendering the entire component tree, including all child components. This comprehensive rendering method is more suitable for integration testing, allowing developers to assess how components interact with one another within the application.

    "answer": "Here are some key steps to handle and prevent security issues in a React application.\n\n\n\nDependency Management: Update the project's dependencies regularly, including React and its related libraries. Use package management tools like npm or yarn to easily track and apply security updates.\n\n\nCode Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential security issues. Encourage team members to follow secure coding practices and adhere to React's guidelines for mitigating common vulnerabilities.\n\n\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS): Prevent XSS attacks by using React's built-in mechanisms, such as JSX escaping. Avoid rendering user-generated content directly into the DOM without proper sanitization.\n\n\nState Management: Be cautious with how you manage and store sensitive data in the React application. Utilize secure storage options, like cookies or the browser's local storage, and avoid exposing sensitive information in the client-side code.\n\n\nAuthentication and Authorization: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access sensitive parts of the application. Employ libraries like React Router to manage routing securely.\n\n\nHTTPS: Deploy the React application over HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server, reducing the risk of data interception or tampering during transit.\n\n\nContent Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the application loads scripts, styles, and other resources. This helps prevent unauthorized code execution and mitigates risks associated with third-party integrations.\n\n\nInput Validation: Validate and sanitize user input on both the client and server sides to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection or NoSQL injection.\n\n\nSecurity Headers: Set security headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection to enhance the security of your React application and prevent common web vulnerabilities.",

    "answer": "Fragments in React are a way to group multiple child elements without introducing unnecessary parent elements in the DOM. Fragments are useful to return multiple elements from a component, as React components are required to render a single parent element. Fragments allow developers to avoid adding extra divs or other elements solely for the purpose of satisfying this requirement.\n\n\nFor example, consider a React component that needs to render a list of items. Use a fragment to group them together Instead of wrapping the list items in a div or another container element as shown below.\n\n\nThe empty angle brackets `<>` and `</>` in this example represent a fragment.

Using CSS Modules resolves the global scope issue of CSS and provides better maintainability.\n\n\nStyled components: Styled components enable developers to write CSS directly within JavaScript files using tagged template literals. Styled components offer a more dynamic approach to styling and are preferred for their component-specific styling.\n\n\nCSS-in-JS: CSS-in-JS libraries like Emotion or styled-components offer a way to encapsulate styles within components, making it easy to manage styles alongside the component code.\n\n\nTailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to apply styles using the class names. Tailwind CSS promotes rapid development but is not suitable for all projects.\n\n\n\nI prefer using Styled components for styling React components because of its component-centric styling approach, dynamic styling capabilities, scoped styling, ease of maintenance, and strong community support.",
